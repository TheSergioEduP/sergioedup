                        <h1>About</h1>
                        <p>Hi, I'm Sérgio Pereira (He/They) but usually go by SergioEduP or TheSergioEduP online.</p>
                        <p>You can read my introduction on my blog post<a href="/blog/2024/12/26/hello-welcome-and-why">.1 - Hello, welcome and why?</a>, but here is a shorter version:</p>
                        <p>I'm a maker from Portugal born in 2001 who has collected a lot of hobbies over the years such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using Arch BTW (messing around with Linux)</li>
                            <li>Learning</li>
                            <li>Programming</li>
                            <li>3D Modeling for 3D Printing</li>
                            <li>Sketching</li>
                            <li>Gaming</li>
                            <li>and even Making little Games</li>
                            <li>(and as a bonus I guess Blogging now)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Unfortunately I've also collected a bunch of anxiety and bad habits over the years by spending too much time on the same 5 websites, anxiety that lead me to not share much of what I make and deleting the little that I did share.</p>
                        <p>But during 2024 I've identified a lot of these bad habits and cues that trigger them and I decided to take action against them, to actually make things and share them since that is what makes me happy, this website is where I will do just that, and hopefully inspire some people to do the same.</p>
                        <p>I know I'm not the best at any of the things that I do but that won't stop me from trying and sharing what I end up making, doesn't matter if I succeed or fail, it is a learning process that will make me better at whatever I decide to try my hand at and will also serve as a learning process to anyone who might read my blog as they might learn a thing or two trough my failures and successes.</p>
                        <p>So if you decide to stay you are more than welcome to join me in this journey that I'm embarking on!</p>
                        <p>You may find me at these places:</p>
