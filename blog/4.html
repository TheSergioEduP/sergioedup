    <h1>.4 - Quick list of projects</h1>
    <h2>2025-02-16</h2>
    <h3>The List:</h3>
    <p>I will try to keep this one short, as I said last week I want to fight my anxiety, and to do that I want to work on my projects and ideas and share them here. So here is an unorganized list of projects of various sizes that I want to work on for the next little while:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finish the design of my slim 3D printed wallet</li>
        <li>Design and 3D Print supports for Ikea SKYDRAG light bars for my workshop workbench/printer area</li>
        <li>Mount missing wall outlets on my workshop</li>
        <li>Decorate workshop wall (possibly some geometric drawing with my logo)</li>
        <li>Configure homeassistant with openvpn on a raspberry pi</li>
        <li>Make a Discord bot "soundboard" to interact directly with my custom macropad</li>
        <li>Design and make custom bookshelf for bedroom</li>
        <li>Design and make custom wall decor for bedroom</li>
        <li>Try to fix an old VCR I have laying around</li>
        <li>Design and 3D print toy fridge for my nieces</li>
        <li>Design and Order custom monitor mount for driving sim rig</li>

        <li>Design and 3D print custom toothbrush holder with initials of people</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are a couple more projects on my list that I'm not ready to share yet because I think that they are too far off for now, but I will share them as I go.</p>
    <h3>RSS!</h3>
    <p>So last week I briefly talked about an e-mail that a reader sent me, that reader was Julian Beittel from <a href="https://beittel.net/">beittel.net</a>, and on that e-mail (among other things) was a suggestion to add an RSS feed to this blog. And I must confess that although I knew of the existence of RSS I knew nothing else about it, but after a bit of research I quickly fell in love with it and of course decided to add it (There should be a little button at the top of the page where you can get it).</p> 
    <p>If you don't know what RSS is here is a very simplified overview, RSS is literally just a simple XML file that gets parsed by some software to display posts and link to them, those pieces of software can grab a lot of RSS feeds from different sources and display the last posts in a simple to digest manner, and some of them allow you to set categories and tags to organize them.</p>
    <p>And the best part is that a lot of modern websites like YouTube have RSS feeds for the content on them, they just don't advertise these feeds because it would mean you wouldn't have to use these websites as much, and that's why I immediately fell in love with RSS, I can just grab the feeds for the couple of channels that I want to keep up with using <inline><code>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=[CHANNEL ID]</code></inline> and not be constantly tempted with suggestions by the algorithm and carefully crafted thumbnails and titles, and to top it off I can also add feeds for other cool websites like <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd.com</a> or countless blogs like this one, and even other streaming platforms like Nebula, all of this centralized in one simple and customizable feed reader that only updates the list of posts when I want it to (I am using Newsflash and have it setup to update the feeds on startup) so I am not constantly being bombarded with notifications that distract me!</p>
    <p>So if you haven't already I strongly suggest that you give it a shot!</p>
    <h3>What else have I been up to</h3>
    <p>As I've said in my last blog post I want to and have been making a conscious effort to fight my anxiety, this week I've done two things that I would usually have avoided, I've accepted an invitation by a few co-workers to go have lunch with them (it was the last day of one of them on our company) and I'm happy to say that I had a nice time with them and even chatted a bit, and the other is that I went clothes shopping and actually spent some time looking at most of the clothes on display and even tried them on before buying which is something I've avoided doing for as long as I remember!</p>
    <p>And as I expected and was fully aware, none of those things where anywhere nearly as bad as my monkey brain made me believe that they were, so I will keep on doing these small things until I can get on to bigger ones :)</p>
    <p>As I've said last week I will try to keep this update posts going every week, it might be early or late by a day or two but I will do my best to share my progress on projects and general mental stare, so you better grab that RSS feed (I hope it works lol, have not tried it as of writing this)</p>
