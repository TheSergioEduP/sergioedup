                    <p>Like last year I'm going to do another month long challenge, which has already begun so I'm just
                        going to jump straight into the rules</p>
                    <h2>Rules</h2>
                    <p>Not much has changed from my previous attempt, but I've relaxed rule 4 a little bit, you can read
                        the details of the original rules <a href="/blog/2024/12/30/distraction-free-january/">here</a>
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Only one task at a time,</li>
                        <li>No algorithmically fed content,</li>
                        <li>Background music is allowed (within limits),</li>
                        <li>No social media.</li>
                        In addition to the exceptions that were already part of that rule I have added "videos from
                        previously setup RSS feeds" and, as an experiment this year, Mastodon as I (from my use of it
                        during this year) find that it is significantly different from other social media platforms for
                        a couple of reasons. The main reason is that the main feeds (Home and Local) are finite and
                        highly curateable (that's probably not a word but we'll just roll with it), there is no infinite
                        scroll, so whenever I open it up I only use it for a couple of minutes to catch up with the
                        people I follow and the instance I'm a part of and then I'm at the end of the feed so I quit,
                        the other also very important reason is that due to the general way it works there isn't pretty
                        much any rage-baity content or people following trends just to get clicks, instead there are
                        tons of smaller communities dedicated to what they do that share a lot of cool stuff between
                        them.

                    <h2>The plan™</h2>
                    <p>For this year I wanted to pick up some of the things that worked well last year and double down
                        on them. One of them was reading, so I looked back and wanted to improve on some the the
                        downsides or less ideal things about it. I really liked reading but carrying books around was
                        less than ideal and reading long stretches of text on my phone or tablet put quite a bit of
                        strain on my eyes so I had kept those for manga as with that style of book I wasn't just
                        focusing on lines of text but also frequently stepping back to admire the artworks, so after a
                        bit of research I ended up buying a Kobo Libra Color and am enjoying it a lot, it also has the
                        nice bonus that I can read in bed without the extremely bright non-dimmable lights of my bedroom
                        or the use of my phone for the previously stated reason.</p>
                    <p>I also want to go trough my old accounts like Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, you know, the ones I've
                        not used in a while and terminate them. This is something I should have done a while back but
                        the thoughts on the back of my head kept me from doing it.</p>
                    <p>I want to focus again on my personal projects, some that I had already shared here, starting with
                        the smaller 3D print related ones.</p>
                    <p>Two things that I've already done are canceling my YouTube Premium membership as I have not been
                        using it for the main reason I had got it for (YouTube Music) and I feel like it was pushing me
                        to use YouTube anyway when I didn't really want to because "I was paying for it", the other
                        thing was disabling and clearing my YouTube watch history , I have not used the recommendations
                        on my desktop since last year but they managed to suck me in a bit on my other devices so
                        turning history off gets rid of at least the front page and Shorts.</p>
                    <p>One other thing that I wanted to double down on this year is to be more mindful and aware of the
                        media I consume, and as I was about halfway trough writing this very blog post when <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/@JayTheDevGuy">JayTheDevGuy</a>, who I only recently became a
                        Patreon member of, started a members only stream on his Discord organizing his list of games
                        that he wants to play and later actually played one of them, and as he played the game he did
                        something that I somehow had not thought of before, he took notes, that's it, he wrote down
                        things about the game he was playing, just short bullet points and a few sentences, and that's
                        when I said to myself "that seems like a good way to be more aware of the media I consume". Jay
                        has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRBXGOr6faU">video</a> about Obsidian, a video
                        that I'll admit I had skipped watching because I had already been down that rabbit hole with
                        tons of other videos and got nothing out of it, but after watching him work in real time with it
                        I had to take a look, and I wish I had done before (and also recommend you to watch it), it was
                        noting like the million other videos or blog posts describing huge complex note taking systems,
                        I can probably summarize it with a couple points:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Just write stuff down, don't spend much time thinking,</li>
                        <li>Don't add any complex extensions/systems unless you absolutely need to,</li>
                        <li>Use links and let Obsidian's Graph organize your notes for you. (this one is huge)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So that is what I'm going to do, I wanted to give obsidian another shot, and in fact this very
                        blog post you are reading right now was entirely written in it, so now I have a couple of better
                        guidelines to help me forward. Of course it won't always be practical to write down stuff as I'm
                        trying to enjoy certain pieces of media, but I think I should still get my thoughts down after
                        finishing them.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>And that is about it for now, I have a bunch of projects, both small and big, and now that things
                        have gotten mostly in order from a fairly chaotic previous year I will start to post here more
                        often. I hope to have you around reading about my silly little projects :)</p>
