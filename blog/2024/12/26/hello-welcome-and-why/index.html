                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well it seems like you made it to my blog, somehow, uhm... welcome... since this is my first
                        post here it will serve as an introduction of sorts.
                    </p>
                    <h3>So, who am I?</h3>
                    <p>
                        My name is Sérgio Pereira, pleased to have you browsing around my website, I'm from Portugal so
                        my native language is Portuguese, but as you might have guessed I also speak english (even
                        though it is far from perfect), and sometimes French (even farther from perfect). So there might
                        be some mistakes or things that are written in weird ways in this website, if you find some feel
                        free to shoot me an email at <a
                            href="mailto:webmaster@sergioedup.com">webmaster@sergioedup.com</a> or, when I make it
                        available, create an issue on the github of this website.
                    </p>
                    <h3>And why am I creating this website?</h3>
                    <p>
                        "You could surely just share whatever you want to share here on other already existing social
                        platforms!" you might be saying
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well reason for the creation of this website requires a bit more of history about myself, I was
                        born in 2001, just before the end of the web 1.0 and beginning of the web 2.0, while I didn't
                        get to experience the early web first hand I had the opportunity to browse it's dying remains,
                        by the time I was 7 years old I got my actual first computer, a Magalhães (it was part of one,
                        of many, government projects was created to teach people how to use computers) by then I was
                        already fairly familiar with how to use a computer since my older brother had been teaching me
                        on his desktop, but one of the many things that that computer sparked in me was the curiosity
                        for how they actually do what they do and how I could tell them what I wanted them to do, that
                        later lead me to take a computer programming course in school. One other thing that that
                        computer brought with it for me was nearly unlimited and entirely unrestricted access to the
                        internet (I'm still debating wether that was a good or bad thing), parents back then didn't
                        really understand the internet, they knew it was great for learning, but most of them were
                        pretty clueless to the bad things that could and did happen in it, but that is not really the
                        point, the point is that I spent so much of my life online that I often say that I grew on the
                        Internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And even though by 2008 the old web was mostly replaced by the more modern web 2.0, there was
                        still boundless hope and possibilities for what it could become and what we would be able to do
                        with it. What I don't think anybody expected was for it to become the corporate hellhole that it
                        is today, where you movements are tracked everywhere you go, where every site exists with the
                        sole purpose of making money, and were you are spoonfed mind-numbing content by some black box
                        algorithm just to keep you on these platforms. And I, like many others, got to see it happen
                        first hand, front row seats to watch our home town burn down and be replaced with a bunch of
                        soulless corporate offices...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And up until very recently I just accepted that to be the new reality of the web, an homogenized
                        corporate hellscape were everything and everyone is trying to profit of you and your attention.
                        I had accepted that the old web was dead and not coming back, I even tried to join in a couple
                        of times, I have had an account on pretty much every social platform out there, I even tried to
                        make my own content and publish it on YouTube a couple of times, and every single one of those
                        attempts ended the same way, with a lot of stress and anxiety, the constant comparison of myself
                        with others and trying to make me stand out wile also relatable so that more people come see
                        what I have to show, and the constant pressure from society and these platforms to be successful
                        (whatever that meant). With all of those attempts I ended up closing myself up more and more.
                        The most recent of those attempts was just about a year ago, at the start of 2024, and when I
                        gave up I just convinced myself that it wasn't for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I kept on consuming content online, always unhappy with both the current situation of the
                        internet and my own mental well being, I thought about creating a little website for myself a
                        couple of times since I already owned a domain but never really knew where to start or what to
                        do with it. "It wont fit in to the current landscape and people wont like it", that's what I
                        told myself. That is until I found a youtube channel that goes by the name "Reject Convenience"
                        with a video about cookies , the kind that we use on web browsers to store data not the ones you
                        eat, a really nice video talking about the history of the cookie and it's uses , one of them,
                        and probably the biggest, was tracking the users for targeted advertisements, and by the end of
                        the video he encouraged us to make our own websites, to show how unhappy we are with the current
                        web situation by creating a space of our own devoid of tracking, ads and corporate greed, a
                        space where we can express ourselves without being forced into these hundreds of little boxes
                        and same-looking webpages. The whole thing resonated a lot with me, and I recommend that you
                        give it a watch too, so I took a look at this guy's website and it felt different, it was a
                        really simple while staying unique, and most importantly it definitely was not something I was
                        expecting to see on the modern web where almost all websites follow one of a couple of
                        templates, and there was this one weird thing at the bottom of the home page, a "webring" that
                        goes by "sillyring" (which you might have noticed at the bottom of my page too), now I know that
                        a web ring is essentially a circular collection of websites but at the time I had never heard of
                        a webring so I clicked it, and was very surprised to see links to more personal and unique
                        webpages of like-minded people, and each page pointed to even more pages, I was sucked in,
                        something that had not happen since the modern social media sites took over, I was
                        <i>surfing</i> the web, I must have crossed at least 100 pages, each of them unique and with
                        something special to give us, and for the first time in nearly two decades I felt like I was
                        back home, meeting with a long forgotten friend that had spent all this time waiting for my
                        return. I actually cried a bit. And am crying again as I write this.
                    </p>
                    <h3>So what is this website's purpose?</h3>
                    <p>
                        After spending a couple of hours browsing these websites and what they had to offer it was clear
                        to me what I wanted, I just want a place that I can call my own on the web to share my stuff, be
                        it my toughs and feelings, little pieces of software I make every once in a while or photos of
                        trips and actual physical projects that I make. This is what this website is, a no-bullshit home
                        for myself on the web, no tracking, no ads, no worrying about pleasing some sort of algorithm,
                        no likes or view counters, just 100% me and my creations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oh and it gives me entire control of how the page looks and and 100% creative freedom so I can
                        do stuff like this:
                    </p>
                    <marquee>Weeeeeee</marquee>
                    <p>I bet you have not seen one of those since Facebook took over! Anyway,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's not to say that I will stop using other platforms, hosting some types of content ist
                        still pretty annoying so I'll let them handle it for me (I'll talk more about it as I see fit),
                        but this website will become my main way of sharing what I like and what I do. And all of it
                        powered by my messy spaghetti code and basic (but steadily improving) artistic skills. It sure
                        as hell is not perfect (whatever you might define as perfect), but it is MY imperfect little
                        home on the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, that's about it for now, I know that my writing is a bit messy but I really have not taken
                        the time to write anything longer than a sentence since I finished school and my mind is all
                        over the place right now, but this will surely improve with practice :)
                    </p>
