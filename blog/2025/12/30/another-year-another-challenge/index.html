                    <p>So this has been quite a chaotic year, and also a pretty chaotic month for me particularly, this
                        is just a quick post to let it be know that I'm going to be doing <a
                            href="/blog/2024/12/30/distraction-free-january/">Distraction Free January</a> again next
                        month!</p>
                    <p>Again this month has been a bit chaotic for me so I didn't have the time to write everything down
                        but it is going to be mostly the same as last time. I did spend some time preparing some things
                        to do and also took a quick look at my stats from this year on YouTube where I spent (on
                        average) about 125 hours per month which is quite a lot better than the previous 200h/mo but
                        still not ideal.</p>
                    <p>If this is something that interests you consider checking out <a

                        something very similar, and consider doing it yourself too! I'll be writing more details about
                        my plans next week.</p>
