            It would seem like you have stumbled your way to my personal website, well, welcome to the webiest of sites on the whole of the widest web of this world! Feel free to look at the blog, there is more info (and links) about myself on the about page, and there are a bunch of cool tools that I use and cool websites that inspire me on the footer (I will probably add more as I discover them).
        </p>

            As tradition demands this website is an eternal work in progress, and just about everything here is a temporary placeholder.
            (Also just as a warning, this website is mainy designed for desktop even though I try to make it work decently on mobile, and it does require javascript enabled to work)
        </p>
        <p class="flex-element">
            Feel free to include my badge on your website, you can selfhost it but I would prefer if you liked to it so that it stays updated in case I decide to change it.
        </p>
        <p class="flex-element" style="text-align: center;">
            Badge:
